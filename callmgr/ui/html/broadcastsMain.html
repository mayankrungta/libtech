                          <p> Following are the Steps that are required to do the Broadcast</p>
                          <ol>
                                  <li><b>Determine the Type of Broadcast</b></br>There are two types of Broadcasts.
                                  <ul>
                                          <li><b>Group Based</b> This Broadcast will go to predefined groups. Like  Panchayat president groups, karyakartas group. If you have set of existing numbers then you can choose this type of Broadcasts. </li>
                                          <li><b>Geo Location Specific</b> This Broadcast will go to people specific to a particular location. you can Broadcast to entire district, block or panchayat. </li>
                                        </li>
                                      </ul> 
                                  </li>
                                  <li><b> Create a Group</b></br>For the first time when you want to Broadcast to a specific group. You would first need to create a Group. You can create a group and add numbers to it. The needs to be done only once. (Note the system also allows you to add numbers to existing groups)</li>
                                  <li><b>Upload audio file </b></br>You need to upload the audio file. Do note that the audio file needs to be there in only .wav format. Other audio files at present are not accepted. If you have an audio file which is not in .wav format, you can covert it by the following two methods
                                  <ul>
                                          <li>Do it through the audacity software.</li>
                                          <li>Do it online by going to <a href="http://media.io"> media.io</a></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  </br>For some technical incompability between multiple vendors we use for Broadcast, you are required to upload the audio file in two places. (It is work in progress to fix this). You would need to upload audio to following two places. 
                                  <ul>
                                          <li>Libtech System</li>
                                          <li>Tringo System</a></li>
                          </ul>
                                  Once you will upload the audio file you will get the file ID from both the places. You need to fill the fileid in the next step`
                                  </li>
                                  <li><b> Fill the create Broadcast Form</b> </br> Once you have done the above you can create the broadcast, by filling the form. You would have to fill various details, such as startDate, endDate and various other parameters of Broadcast.
                                  </li>
                                </ol>
                  </td>
                  <td valign="top">
                          <ul>
